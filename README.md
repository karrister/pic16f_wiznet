pic16f_wiznet
=============

A project to make a simple WEB server/client out of a PIC16F690 uC using Wiznet 5100 chip (ETH PHY & stack on chip over SPI).


The purpose of this project is to pass the Embedded Networking course project held in Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.

Currently the aim is to make a simple WEB server that can be used to control the 4 LEDs on the PIC16F690 development board that is attached to the WIZNET 5100 CHIP over SPI.
